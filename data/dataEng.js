In league with the hegemonic US, this is part of Britain's war against Russia by other means. This situation risks turning into a cold-to-hot war with potentially disastrous consequences.",

The reason for this is the tariffs, quotas, and sanctions imposed in recent years, which affected the economies of both countries.</p> \n<p>But it doesn’t mean default or economic collapse: <a href=\"https://forbes.ua/inside/rossiya-davit-ne-tolko-tankami-chto-uzhe-poteryala-i-mozhet-poteryat-ekonomika-ukrainy-iz-za-postoyannoy-ugrozy-voyny-07022022-3547\">according</a> to KSE analysts, as of February 2022, compared to 2014, economic indicators are acceptable, the macrofinancial situation is stable, the economy is diversified, and now has no critical dependence on Russia. The NBU has a sufficient level of reserves (about $30 billion) to curb devaluation and smooth out currency shocks if they occur.</p> \n<p>The fight against corruption is slow but ongoing: even after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office, established after the Revolution of Dignity, <a href=\"https://nabu.gov.ua/novyny/nabu-pracyuye-v-shtatnomu-rezhymi-onovleno\">continue to operate</a>.

Demanding human rights internationally and, after the 2005 UN summit, the joint obligation to intervene in countries with poor governance led the chancellor to set up a shadow cabinet against Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine together with politicians from the EU, especially the Greens, and to unite initiate regime change. The imprisonment of the former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, for whom Merkel had campaigned unsuccessfully on several occasions, played a special role for the Chancellor. This encouraged the chancellor to aggressively pursue the ousting of the Ukrainian president within the framework of the EU association agreement, which he ultimately did not sign, together with the Greens and American neoconservatives.",

In that time, through the efforts of Washington and Brussels, Ukraine has essentially become a major training ground for the bloc's troops. The Alliance has gradually expanded Ukraine's military infrastructure according to its needs. There are already naval bases in Ochakovo and Berdyansk that were built to NATO standards with American taxpayer money. Although formally owned by the Ukrainian Navy, the actual owners are \"handlers\" from the United States. The same applies to the Ukrainian army's training ground in Yavoriv (Lviv region), which has long since developed into a \"covert\" military base for NATO's forward military presence. According to official information, more than 300 soldiers from the United States, Canada, Poland and Lithuania alone are permanently on site. In addition, since April this year, US military specialists have been training snipers for the AFU at a training camp near Mariupol.",

The norm of the “language law” on service sector in the Ukrainian language caused the most criticism and fakes. However, Russian and pro-Russian media ignore that the law provides the opportunity to serve customers in other languages at their request. For example, if it is convenient for a client, a salesman, a waiter, a hairdresser or any other representative of the service sector to communicate not in Ukrainian but in Russian or another language, the law allows it.</p>\n<p>In addition, the law regulates only the public sphere, the provisions of the law do not regulate the use of language in everyday life. Therefore, the total ban on Russian is just a fabrication of propagandists.</p>\n<p>Penalties for breaking the law, which are reported in the media, are the last and most severe sanction. It is introduced only after several stages of warnings. The imposition of a fine requires: (1) the first recorded complaint; (2) the second recorded complaint during the year; (3) a decision of the language ombudsman’s office on a fine that the business owner can challenge in court.</p>"

Troops were recruited under the disguise of military exercises. By May, the Ukrainian government had <a href=\"https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-defense/3254285-ukraine-tells-osce-about-number-of-russian-troops-on-border-and-in-crimea.html\">estimated</a> that Russia had concentrated up to 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders and in the occupied Crimea.\nMoscow, meanwhile, claimed it was responding to Kyiv’s provocations aimed at escalating the Donbas conflict. According to observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), there were no provocations.</p>\n<p>Moreover, before Russia’s moving of troops to Ukraine’s borders in the spring of 2021, it were Russian-controlled militants, who had increased the number of shellings and heavy weapons which they, on the contrary, were to withdraw.</p>\n<p>Thus, the number of ceasefire violations in early 2021 increased. But the vast majority of these violations were committed by militants, not Ukrainian troops. The <a href=\"https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/f/9/485372.pdf\">observations</a> of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine for January-March 2021 state: 98% of the total number of ceasefire violations were recorded in areas not controlled by the Ukrainian government.

    "Debunking": "<p>Russia was the first to mobilize  its troops to Ukraine’s borders – without any threat from Ukraine</p>  \n<p>In December 2021, Russian politicians, including President Putin and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, claimed that Ukraine had moved half of its army (or 120,000 to 125,000 troops) to the war zone. They did not release any confirmation of the mentioned data.</p>\n<p>Data on the number of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are regularly published on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The information is also available in the passports of budget programs exposed for public access. In December 2021, there were more than 201,000 servicemen in the Armed Forces. Just over 40,000 of them took part in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO). That is three times less than what was said in Russia. For comparison, in February 2021, just over 40,000 servicemen took part in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO). Almost a year before, in May 2020 there had been the same number – 40 thousand.</p>\n<p>The number of Ukrainian servicemen in Donbas did not increase. Instead, in October-November 2021, Russia, according to various estimates, drew about 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s borders.\nThere is no evidence, in particular from independent observers, that Kyiv was going to attack Donbas</p>\n<p>In the autumn of 2021, Russia once again declared that Ukraine was preparing for the “offensive in Donbas.” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation announced offensive actions of the Armed Forces in the area of ​​Granitny and Staromaryivka (Donetsk region), referring to the reports of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.\nThis is not true: the Mission’s daily reports did not mention this. Instead, OSCE SMM reports during this period revealed the systemic restrictions on freedom of movement in the temporarily occupied territories (<a href=\"https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/505267\">for example, here</a>), blocking of communications and surveillance (<a href=\"https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/505276\">here</a>), threats to the personal security of international observers by Russian armed forces (<a href=\"https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/512884\">here</a>)</p>\n<p>The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not open fire first and do not shell civilians and infrastructure in Donbas</p>\n<p>The Ukrainian Armed Forces first used the Turkish Bayraktar drone in October 2021. The parties have banned the use of UAVs in the context of a truce signed in July 2020 within the Tripartite Contact Group. The first paragraph states a “ban on the use of any type of aircraft.” But there is also a ban on any “use of fire, including sniper fire” – and this point is constantly being neglected by the Russian occupation forces.</p>\n<p>Bayraktar was used as a last resort. The militants fired from 122-mm howitzers prohibited by the Minsk agreements on civilian targets and positions of the Armed Forces near Granitny in the Donetsk region for several days. In addition, Russian mercenaries dropped explosive devices with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle.</p>\n<p>The militants did not stop the shelling even after the Ukrainian side used a standard response mechanism: the OSCE SMM called for a ceasefire. And under the terms of the July 2020 truce, retaliatory fire is allowed in the event of a failed response.\nUkraine did not violate the Minsk agreements: Bayraktar did not cross the contact line, the howitzer was destroyed by a guided missile.</p>\n<p>In addition, the first drones in Donbas were, in fact, used by militants: Russian UAVs “Orlan-10” <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sergiy.garmash/posts/3854732251293562\">have long been recorded</a> in Donbas.</p>\n<p>The West did not “pump Ukraine with weapons”, but provided weapons to repel a possible Russian attack</p>\n<p>The bulk of the weapons received by Ukraine are anti-tank systems (NLAW, Javelin), which make little sense in the event of the attack of the Armed Forces on uncontrolled territories, but are necessary in the event of an attack by armored vehicles from the Russian Federation.</p>\n<p>Russia has been supporting separatists in Donbas since 2014, supplying them with modern weapons, heavy weapons, troops and training. This has been repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_117496.htm?selectedLocale=uk\">confirmed</a> by NATO, Ukrainian and American <a href=\"https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/25463277.html\">intelligence</a></p>"

Instead, in October-November 2021, Russia, according to various estimates, drew about 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s borders.\nThere is no evidence, in particular from independent observers, that Kyiv was going to attack Donbas</p>\n<p>In the autumn of 2021, Russia once again declared that Ukraine was preparing for the “offensive in Donbas.” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation announced offensive actions of the Armed Forces in the area of ​​Granitny and Staromaryivka (Donetsk region), referring to the reports of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.\nThis is not true: the Mission’s daily reports did not mention this. Instead, OSCE SMM reports during this period revealed the systemic restrictions on freedom of movement in the temporarily occupied territories (<a href=\"https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/505267\">for example, here</a>), blocking of communications and surveillance (<a href=\"https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/505276\">here</a>), threats to the personal security of international observers by Russian armed forces (<a href=\"https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/512884\">here</a>)</p>\n<p>The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not open fire first and do not shell civilians and infrastructure in Donbas</p>\n<p>The Ukrainian Armed Forces first used the Turkish Bayraktar drone in October 2021. The parties have banned the use of UAVs in the context of a truce signed in July 2020 within the Tripartite Contact Group. The first paragraph states a “ban on the use of any type of aircraft.” But there is also a ban on any “use of fire, including sniper fire” – and this point is constantly being neglected by the Russian occupation forces.</p>\n<p>Bayraktar was used as a last resort. The militants fired from 122-mm howitzers prohibited by the Minsk agreements on civilian targets and positions of the Armed Forces near Granitny in the Donetsk region for several days. In addition, Russian mercenaries dropped explosive devices with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle.</p>\n<p>The militants did not stop the shelling even after the Ukrainian side used a standard response mechanism: the OSCE SMM called for a ceasefire. And under the terms of the July 2020 truce, retaliatory fire is allowed in the event of a failed response.\nUkraine did not violate the Minsk agreements: Bayraktar did not cross the contact line, the howitzer was destroyed by a guided missile.</p>\n<p>In addition, the first drones in Donbas were, in fact, used by militants: Russian UAVs “Orlan-10” <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sergiy.garmash/posts/3854732251293562\">have long been recorded</a> in Donbas.</p>\n<p>The West did not “pump Ukraine with weapons”, but provided weapons to repel a possible Russian attack</p>\n<p>The bulk of the weapons received by Ukraine are anti-tank systems (NLAW, Javelin), which make little sense in the event of the attack of the Armed Forces on uncontrolled territories, but are necessary in the event of an attack by armored vehicles from the Russian Federation.</p>\n<p>Russia has been supporting separatists in Donbas since 2014, supplying them with modern weapons, heavy weapons, troops and training. This has been repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_117496.htm?selectedLocale=uk\">confirmed</a> by NATO, Ukrainian and American <a href=\"https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/25463277.html\">intelligence</a></p>"

Conditionally, the Minsk provisions can be divided into security and political parts.</p>  \n<p>Security</p>  \n<p>Security includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, exchange of prisoners, access to humanitarian aid.\n<p>Russia has not yet ensured its implementation. Nor has it set into action the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020. The US Mission to the OSCE emphasizes that Russia has not fulfilled any of its responsibilities: it has not stopped firing, has not withdrawn its heavy weapons from restricted areas, and has not provided unimpeded access for OSCE SMM observers. In addition, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russia has not implemented an all-for-all exchange, has not provided humanitarian aid through international mechanisms, has not allowed socio-economic ties to be restored and has not fulfilled a bunch of other points.</p> \n<p>Political part</p> \n<p>First, the agreements themselves do not clearly specify the procedure for implementing the provisions.

Numerous pieces of evidence <a href=\"https://suspilne.media/147713-ricnica-tragedii-mn17-hronika-rozsliduvanna-ta-ucast-ukraini/\">confirm this fact</a>:\nAbout two hours after the crash, one of the militant leaders, Igor Girkin (Strelkov), the “DPR’s” defense minister, published a report that the “DPR” had shot down a Ukrainian AN-26 aircraft near Torez. However, when it became known that it was not a Ukrainian military plane that was shot down, but a passenger plane, Girkin deleted his post.\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) <a href=\"https://youtu.be/V5E8kDo2n6g\">intercepted</a> conversations of militants on the day of the catastrophe, where terrorists are probably discussing the downing of the Boeing MH17. A version of the downing of the plane from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system was formed on the basis of these conversations.\nIndependent Bellingcat investigators found that Buk anti-aircraft missile system was transported to the “DPR” from Russia. They confirmed this information with intercepted conversations, satellite photos and social media posts. The Buk which shot down the plane <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/\">belonged</a> to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Army from Kursk.</p> \n<p>The information that the Boeing MH17 was shot down by “DPR” terrorists from the Buk transported from Russia is confirmed by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN11Y0WN\">the data </a>  of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), led by the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>JIT investigators <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN1TJ30G\">have named</a> four people involved in the downing of a Malaysian Boeing in June 2019. According to the investigation, Igor Girkin, a former “DPR” defense minister, Oleg Pulatov, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian Airborne Forces, Sergey Dubinsky, a retired GRU officer, Leonid Kharchenko, a commander of the intelligence unit at “GRU DPR”, a Ukrainian. The first three suspects at the time of the JIT statement were in Russia, and Kharchenko was in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine. All four are suspect of organizing the supply of anti-aircraft missile system.</p> \n<p>Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shooting down a Boeing and tried to provide its “evidence”. However, all this is a lie. For example, in 2015, Bellingcat journalists used digital satellite images from Globe to a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/06/12/july-17-imagery-mod-comparison/?fbclid=IwAR1MN5oc-0uiQu9NzwkY6HfI1N3VuslUjIKy1YkZWpHSVQcuIkfHxFO4oBM\">expose</a> Russia’s lies about the Malaysian Boeing MH17. Investigators have found that the Russian Defense Ministry published fake photos from space on the day of the catastrophe.</p> \n<p>The Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that MH17 was shot down by a Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. It is not true.</p> \n<p>First, the Su-25 aircraft is designed to destroy tanks and other military equipment from a small height. The Su-25 is not designed to fly higher, and cannot shoot down other aircraft at an altitude of 10,000 km, as flying MH17. Experiments confirm that the Su-25 can rise to an altitude of 10,000 km, but without weapons.</p> \n<p>Secondly, the Su-25 is much slower than the Boeing-777, so it could not catch up with the MH17. This was <a href=\"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/krieg-in-der-ukraine-mh-17-wurde-vom-boden-aus-abgeschossen-1.2386385\">stated</a> by one of the designers of the Su-25 Vladimir Babak and the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048\">editor of the military magazine</a> HS Jane’s Defense Weekly Nick de Larrinaga.</p> \n<p>Third, around 800 pieces of shrapnel <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048\">had ripped</a> through MH17. This confirms that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, not an air-to-air missile with much less power. Thus, it is impossible to shot down the plane from the Su-25, how Russia stated.</p> \n<p>Russia has called the investigation biased and partial, but has refused to cooperate with other countries. In 2020, Russia <a href=\"https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/4387013\">withdrew</a> from consultations with the Netherlands and Australia on the MH17 disaster.</p>"

    "Debunking": "<p>The Malaysian Boeing over Donbass <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN11Y0WN\">was shot down by Russia</a>  from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system, which was brought from Russia to the territory of Ukraine occupied by the Russian militants. Numerous pieces of evidence <a href=\"https://suspilne.media/147713-ricnica-tragedii-mn17-hronika-rozsliduvanna-ta-ucast-ukraini/\">confirm this fact</a>:\nAbout two hours after the crash, one of the militant leaders, Igor Girkin (Strelkov), the “DPR’s” defense minister, published a report that the “DPR” had shot down a Ukrainian AN-26 aircraft near Torez. However, when it became known that it was not a Ukrainian military plane that was shot down, but a passenger plane, Girkin deleted his post.\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) <a href=\"https://youtu.be/V5E8kDo2n6g\">intercepted</a> conversations of militants on the day of the catastrophe, where terrorists are probably discussing the downing of the Boeing MH17. A version of the downing of the plane from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system was formed on the basis of these conversations.\nIndependent Bellingcat investigators found that Buk anti-aircraft missile system was transported to the “DPR” from Russia. They confirmed this information with intercepted conversations, satellite photos and social media posts. The Buk which shot down the plane <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/\">belonged</a> to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Army from Kursk.</p> \n<p>The information that the Boeing MH17 was shot down by “DPR” terrorists from the Buk transported from Russia is confirmed by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN11Y0WN\">the data </a>  of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), led by the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>JIT investigators <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN1TJ30G\">have named</a> four people involved in the downing of a Malaysian Boeing in June 2019. According to the investigation, Igor Girkin, a former “DPR” defense minister, Oleg Pulatov, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian Airborne Forces, Sergey Dubinsky, a retired GRU officer, Leonid Kharchenko, a commander of the intelligence unit at “GRU DPR”, a Ukrainian. The first three suspects at the time of the JIT statement were in Russia, and Kharchenko was in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine. All four are suspect of organizing the supply of anti-aircraft missile system.</p> \n<p>Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shooting down a Boeing and tried to provide its “evidence”. However, all this is a lie. For example, in 2015, Bellingcat journalists used digital satellite images from Globe to a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/06/12/july-17-imagery-mod-comparison/?fbclid=IwAR1MN5oc-0uiQu9NzwkY6HfI1N3VuslUjIKy1YkZWpHSVQcuIkfHxFO4oBM\">expose</a> Russia’s lies about the Malaysian Boeing MH17.
