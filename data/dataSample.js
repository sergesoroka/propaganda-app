Demanding human rights internationally and, after the 2005 UN summit, the joint obligation to intervene in countries with poor governance led the chancellor to set up a shadow cabinet against Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine together with politicians from the EU, especially the Greens, and to unite initiate regime change. The imprisonment of the former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, for whom Merkel had campaigned unsuccessfully on several occasions, played a special role for the Chancellor. This encouraged the chancellor to aggressively pursue the ousting of the Ukrainian president within the framework of the EU association agreement, which he ultimately did not sign, together with the Greens and American neoconservatives.",

Die Menschenrechte international einzufordern und nach dem UN-Gipfel 2005 die gemeinsame Verpflichtung, in Ländern mit schlechter Regierungsführung zu intervenieren, brachte die Kanzlerin dazu, zusammen mit Politikern der EU, insbesondere auch der Grünen, ein Schattenkabinett gegen Viktor Janukowitsch in der Ukraine aufzubauen und einen Regime-Change anzubahnen. Eine besondere Rolle spielte für die Kanzlerin dabei die Inhaftierung der ehemaligen ukrainischen Premierministerin Julia Timoschenko, für die sich Merkel mehrfach erfolglos eingesetzt hatte. Das bestärkte die Kanzlerin darin, die Entmachtung des ukrainischen Präsidenten im Rahmen des von ihm letztlich nicht unterschriebenen EU-Assoziierungsabkommen, zusammen mit Grünen und amerikanischen Neokonservativen, aggressiv zu betreiben.",

The Alliance has gradually expanded Ukraine's military infrastructure according to its needs. There are already naval bases in Ochakovo and Berdyansk that were built to NATO standards with American taxpayer money. Although formally owned by the Ukrainian Navy, the actual owners are \"handlers\" from the United States. The same applies to the Ukrainian army's training ground in Yavoriv (Lviv region), which has long since developed into a \"covert\" military base for NATO's forward military presence.

The coup d'état in Kyiv was carried out by these \"nationalists without a nation\".
