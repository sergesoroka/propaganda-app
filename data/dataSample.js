      "Disinfo_cases_en": "The war in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas has now been going on for almost eight years. It was sparked by a NATO-backed coup in Kyiv in February 2014 against an elected government allied with Russia. The new regime was characterized by anti-Russian policies and neo-Nazi ideology.",

      "Debunking": "In 2021, The American George Washington Institute published(https://www.illiberalism.org/far-right-group-made-its-home-in-ukraines-major-western-military-training-hub/) a report stating that the far-right group Centuria has been using the Sagaidachny National Army Academy to recruit new members. The Ministry of Defense said it would conduct an inspection. \n \nCommenting on the report, the Russian media resorted to numerous manipulations in order to further push the fundamentally untrue claim that neo-Nazi groups have infiltrated the Ukrainian government. \"There are dozens of organizations that are not just far-right, but openly pro-Nazi, and their merging with law enforcement agencies, state authorities and local self-government has become an open secret\" wrote(https://klymenko-time.com/novosti/naczizm-s-gosfinansirovaniem-kak-podderzhivaemaya-ssha-voennaya-akademiya-stala-domom-dlya-ultrapravoj-organizaczii-centuria-yutk/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=smm&utm_campaign=novosti_ktime_telegram) Klymenko Time. The First Independent, on the other hand, spoke of \"Nazis roaming the streets of Ukraine.\" \n \nLet’s address the elephant in the room. Ukraine, like the overwhelming majority of developed countries, including Russia, has a number of organizations belonging to the far right of the political spectrum, but these organizations are few and do not enjoy the levels of support in society and government the pro-Kremlin media tries to portray them as having. In the last parliamentary election, nationalist parties have won a resounding 1 (one) seat out of 450 available.  \n \nAn article from the Russian website Ukraina.ru (a propaganda publication of the Russia-1 media group) with a manipulative headline was reprinted on the website(https://112ua.tv/mnenie/prozrenie-ot-freedom-house-vnesudebnye-raspravy-i-podderzhka-neonacistov-na-ukraine-592543.html) of the TV channel 112 Ukraine, alleging that the international human rights organization Freedom House has “admitted that Ukraine supports neo-Nazi gangs”. However, at no point does the report(https://freedomhouse.org/country/ukraine/freedom-net/2021) claim that the Ukrainian government directly supports neo-Nazis. \n \nOn the \"First Independent\" tv channel, the lion's share of air time was also allocated to the discussion of Nazism in Ukraine. Andriy Telizhenko, a self-proclaimed “diplomat”, compares Ukraine to Nazi Germany: \"You remember how Germany once said that they would not go to war, and would not attack anyone. At the same time, they amassed at the borders of other countries and created the Second World War. This is what Ukraine is doing today with negotiations in the Normandy format, prolonging the process. And then, they will provoke and declare: \"You see, this is all the Russian Federation, this is not us, we want peace, we want victory.\" \n \nIn the same broadcast, two laws are presented as the evidence of the popularity of \"Nazism\" in Ukraine: \"Please take the law on language. Purely Nazi law - once. Take the law on indigenous peoples. Purely Nazi law - two.\" Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has also compared the law on indigenous peoples to the \"practice of Nazi Germany.\" \n \nThese two laws are perhaps the most misrepresented legal documents in recent history. As an example, \"Vesti\" has portrayed(https://vesti.ua/politika/vladimir-skachko-bessilie-oon-kak-zelenskij-lepit-svoyu-erzats-diktaturu) the language law as being about \"forced Ukrainization\" and claimed the Law on Indigenous Peoples \"threw Russians to the sidelines.\" Whereas Russians, by definition, cannot be the indigenous people of Ukraine, or, for that matter, any country other than Russia, as they have their own state formation."
